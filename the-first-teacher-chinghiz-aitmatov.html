<p>The First Teacher (První učitel, 1962) is novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinghiz_Aitmatov">Chinghiz Aitmatov</a>. I found it in a book Selection of Soviet War and Post-war Literature. I read it because my literature teacher Mr. Štěpánek like the author. Generally, I am into russian literature (Dostoyevsky, Bulgakov).</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The novel describes work of keen young self-taught teacher Düjšen and his impact on life of Altynaj. Altynaj is an orphan and Düjšen is promise of better future for her. She starts to loves her first teacher but after she goes to city they will never meet again.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>It is strong story of good versus evil people. Story of very keen good man whose work is never appreciated. It is propagandist literature. That is probably the reason why it is in the collection book. Düjšen is communist who admire Lenin and he will do anythin for the party. I think this book shows how communism from point of individual can bring a lot of positive (gives power to a man to educate a village). But from the collective perspective it fails.</p>
