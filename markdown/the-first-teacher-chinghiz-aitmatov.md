# The First Teacher, Chinghiz Aitmatov

Published on 19th March 2017.

The First Teacher (První učitel, 1962) is novel by
[Chinghiz Aitmatov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinghiz_Aitmatov).
I found it in a book Selection of Soviet War and Post-war Literature.
I read it because my literature teacher Mr. Štěpánek like the author.
Generally, I am into russian literature (Dostoyevsky, Bulgakov).

## Plot

The novel describes work of keen young self-taught teacher Düjšen
and his impact on life of Altynaj.
Altynaj is an orphan and Düjšen is promise of better future for her.
She starts to loves her first teacher but after she goes to city
they will never meet again.

## Thoughts

It is strong story of good versus evil people.
Story of very keen good man whose work is never appreciated.
It is propagandist literature.
That is probably the reason why it is in the collection book.
Düjšen is communist who admire Lenin
and he will do anythin for the party.
I think this book shows how communism from point of individual
can bring a lot of positive (gives power to a man to educate a village).
But from the collective perspective it fails.
