Deep Q-network ([DQN][1]) is a DeepRL system which combines deep neural networks
with reinforcement learning and is able to master a diverse range of
[Atari 2600][3] games with only the raw pixels and score as input.
This work represent a general-purpose agent that is able to adapt its
behavior without any human intervanition.
Therefore, it is a major technical step forward to general aritificial
intelligence.
I am writing this article to get better understandig of it.

Truly intelligent artificial agents should excel at a wide variety of tasks.
This algorithm leverages recent breakthroughs in training deep neural networks
to show that DQN is able to achieve superhuman performance across a diverse
range of 49 game scenarios.
