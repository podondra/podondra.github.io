Here I present my incomplete thought on computable creativity
which I do not want to lose.

I watched [movie about AlphaGo][movie]
and in the second game there is the [move 37][the-move]
which was noted as *creative* and *unique* by a lot of spectators.

[movie]: https://www.alphagomovie.com/ 
[the-move]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol#Game_2

The point I would like to make is that if creativity and uniqueness is defined
by what people think of these term
than the deterministically computed move was creative
which would lead us to the idea that creativity is computable.
